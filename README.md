The paper is generated by sourcing file **Manuscript.Rnw**. Please start from that file to trace the paths to all code files used. 

In order to generate the paper (and source the file board_diversity.Rnw) you need to first generate all data based on the raw data from [WRDS](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu). As we cannot make the WRDS data public (e.g. from CRSP, [Thomson/Reuters SDC](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/financial/market-data/sdc-platinum.html),  and other data sources), it is not possible to generate the pdf report after only downloading/forking all files in this repository - at this stage. Only some of the code is available - other is available upon request. The helper functions and code that constructs are datasets used are available upon request.
